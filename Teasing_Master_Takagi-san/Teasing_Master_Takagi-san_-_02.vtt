1
01:37.250 --> 01:38.790
All right.

2
01:38.870 --> 01:42.200
Now, we're practicing calligraphy,
so write down your favorite thing.

3
01:42.200 --> 01:44.040
Due by the end of the day.

4
01:44.500 --> 01:46.410
Well, I know what I'm writing.

5
01:46.500 --> 01:48.000
Grilled meat.

6
01:48.080 --> 01:49.410
My favorite.

7
01:51.660 --> 01:54.330
Having trouble deciding?

8
01:54.410 --> 01:55.500
Sorta.

9
01:55.580 --> 01:57.160
Did you figure out what you're gonna write?

10
01:57.250 --> 01:59.830
Hmmm... Not just yet.

11
02:00.620 --> 02:01.660
I know.

12
02:01.700 --> 02:04.740
How about we both write down something
that we want from each other?

13
02:05.040 --> 02:08.000
What we want from each other?

14
02:08.080 --> 02:09.250
Uh-huh.

15
02:09.330 --> 02:11.120
Hmm...

16
02:13.120 --> 02:14.450
Okay.

17
02:17.950 --> 02:20.410
What I want from Takagi?

18
02:20.500 --> 02:22.040
Hmm...

19
02:23.790 --> 02:24.700
Duh!

20
02:24.790 --> 02:26.330
For her to stop teasing me!

21
02:26.410 --> 02:29.160
This'll be a good way to tell her off!

22
02:30.910 --> 02:31.480
Wait.

23
02:32.000 --> 02:34.980
Now that I think about it, that might actually backfire.

24
02:35.290 --> 02:38.540
She'd probably call me a wuss and make fun of me more.

25
02:38.620 --> 02:42.250
I need to find a way to make her
sorry without provoking her further.

26
02:44.040 --> 02:46.290
This is harder than it should be.

27
02:50.500 --> 02:52.660
You done? Because I am.

28
02:53.910 --> 02:54.540
Cool.

29
02:54.620 --> 02:56.040
Let's show each other.

30
02:59.870 --> 03:02.000
Howdya like this?

31
03:03.250 --> 03:05.410
"Restraint"?

32
03:05.500 --> 03:07.540
Uh, yeah.

33
03:07.620 --> 03:08.790
With what?

34
03:08.870 --> 03:11.250
I can't really help if you don't specify.

35
03:11.330 --> 03:15.410
Uh... Well, it's, uh, a few different things.

36
03:15.500 --> 03:17.660
She clearly doesn't get it.

37
03:17.750 --> 03:21.460
But then again, at this point if she did get
it, she'd probably get upset.

38
03:21.910 --> 03:23.540
This is tricky.

39
03:26.580 --> 03:28.160
So what about you?

40
03:28.250 --> 03:31.290
What do you mean by "status quo"?

41
03:31.370 --> 03:32.910
Oh, you don't get it?

42
03:33.000 --> 03:38.480
Well, it means you're easy to tease,
and I want you to stay that way, 'Kay?

43
03:38.480 --> 03:40.910
Red alert! She's going on the offensive!

44
03:40.910 --> 03:42.370
It's an ambush!

45
03:42.450 --> 03:44.660
If that's how she wants this to go, fine.

46
03:44.750 --> 03:46.210
Two can play at that game.

47
03:46.210 --> 03:47.950
I'm ready for it now.

48
03:49.660 --> 03:51.580
Are you okay with a do-over?

49
03:51.660 --> 03:53.330
Yeah, sure.

50
03:55.700 --> 03:58.370
Get set to get wrecked, Takagi!

51
03:58.370 --> 04:00.950
I'm about to fight fire with fire!

52
04:02.120 --> 04:03.370
So, did you finish?

53
04:03.450 --> 04:04.870
Almost.

54
04:11.040 --> 04:14.580
This should make Takagi realize
that she isn't exactly kind to me.

55
04:14.580 --> 04:16.000
Can't misinterpret this!

56
04:16.080 --> 04:19.270
Forget what I said before, now I want to upset you!

57
04:19.910 --> 04:22.500
Huh... What should I write?

58
04:22.580 --> 04:24.250
Ho-ho what's this?

59
04:24.330 --> 04:26.000
Having trouble coming up with something?

60
04:26.080 --> 04:27.580
Perhaps if you were a bit kinder,

61
04:27.660 --> 04:30.540
it'd be easy to come up with a
nice, wholesome request from me.

62
04:30.620 --> 04:33.040
Oh. I wanted to tell you earlier,

63
04:33.120 --> 04:35.200
you have really nice handwriting.

64
04:35.290 --> 04:36.870
It has an interesting flare.

65
04:36.950 --> 04:38.750
Have you been taught calligraphy?

66
04:38.830 --> 04:40.950
Uh, no, not really.

67
04:41.040 --> 04:42.660
Hmm?

68
04:42.750 --> 04:44.700
Well, either way,

69
04:44.790 --> 04:46.660
I like it a lot.

70
04:59.250 --> 05:00.620
Here.

71
05:00.700 --> 05:01.830
Uh...

72
05:01.910 --> 05:03.450
Thanks.

73
05:04.540 --> 05:05.660
That's weird.

74
05:05.750 --> 05:08.410
She's being so nice all of a sudden.

75
05:08.500 --> 05:10.080
What's going on?

76
05:11.410 --> 05:12.790
Could it be?

77
05:12.870 --> 05:14.950
Is Takagi actually nice,

78
05:15.040 --> 05:17.410
and I just haven't noticed it until now?

79
05:18.330 --> 05:19.500
No way.

80
05:19.580 --> 05:21.330
I'd have picked up on that.

81
05:24.120 --> 05:27.040
Nishikata, stay still for a second.

82
05:27.120 --> 05:29.290
Huh?!

83
05:29.830 --> 05:31.330
Huh?

84
05:34.410 --> 05:35.200
Got it.

85
05:35.290 --> 05:38.160
Something was on your face.

86
05:38.250 --> 05:39.370
Okay!

87
05:39.450 --> 05:41.870
I think I have something to write now.

88
05:51.950 --> 05:53.450
Do you like my beautiful artwork?

89
05:53.540 --> 05:55.660
You're a weird guy, you know that?

90
05:55.750 --> 05:57.080
What?

91
05:59.330 --> 06:00.410
Okay.

92
06:00.500 --> 06:01.140
I'm done.

93
06:01.160 --> 06:02.750
How about you show me yours first?

94
06:02.830 --> 06:05.120
Uh... Why not at the same time?

95
06:05.200 --> 06:07.330
Just show me already.

96
06:10.370 --> 06:12.620
Ahhh...

97
06:12.700 --> 06:16.080
I was a little more obvious this time, at least.

98
06:16.160 --> 06:18.200
You really do have interesting handwriting.

99
06:18.290 --> 06:20.950
That's all you have to say? Come on.

100
06:21.040 --> 06:22.610
I'm trying to spell it out for you.

101
06:22.610 --> 06:23.540
Stop teasing me.

102
06:23.620 --> 06:25.040
What? I can't!

103
06:25.120 --> 06:27.580
You didn't even give it some thought.

104
06:28.700 --> 06:30.040
All right, I'm sorry.

105
06:30.120 --> 06:32.040
I'll hold back from now on.

106
06:32.120 --> 06:32.830
Thank you.

107
06:32.910 --> 06:34.500
So what's yours say?

108
06:34.580 --> 06:36.620
Curious?

109
06:36.700 --> 06:38.330
Then let's see.

110
06:38.410 --> 06:39.620
Here.

111
06:57.580 --> 06:59.570
When she touched my face.

112
06:59.780 --> 07:02.700
Didn't you just say that you'd hold back from now on?

113
07:02.790 --> 07:05.500
Yeah, but I said that after I already set this up.

114
07:33.120 --> 07:35.160
So hot.

115
07:35.250 --> 07:37.330
Yeah, I guess so.

116
07:37.410 --> 07:40.540
We should start wearing our short-sleeve uniform soon.

117
07:40.620 --> 07:43.580
Yeah. I guess so.

118
07:43.660 --> 07:48.180
Let's just tell Sanae that we're gonna
start wearing them tomorrow, sound good?

119
07:48.270 --> 07:50.310
Yeah, I guess so.

120
07:50.790 --> 07:52.490
You guess what?

121
07:52.950 --> 07:53.790
Huh?

122
07:55.870 --> 07:56.750
Hey.

123
08:03.700 --> 08:04.660
Long sleeves?

124
08:04.750 --> 08:06.580
Aren't you hot?

125
08:12.000 --> 08:13.540
What?

126
08:13.620 --> 08:16.540
We said that we'd all change
our uniforms at the same time!

127
08:16.540 --> 08:17.690
Come on!

128
08:18.370 --> 08:19.750
Wait, we did?

129
08:19.830 --> 08:20.870
Yes, we did!

130
08:20.950 --> 08:22.870
You forgot?

131
08:22.950 --> 08:25.580
Hmm?

132
08:25.660 --> 08:26.910
Yeah.

133
08:32.160 --> 08:37.910
Ahhhh! It's a lot cooler
wearing short sleeves, isn't it?

134
08:38.000 --> 08:40.250
Yeah, I guess so.

135
08:41.290 --> 08:42.120
Hey.

136
08:42.200 --> 08:43.830
You guess what?

137
08:44.870 --> 08:45.450
Hey, Sanae.

138
08:45.540 --> 08:48.410
Good mor... ning.

139
08:54.950 --> 08:56.120
I thought you said

140
08:56.200 --> 08:59.580
we were all gonna change our uniforms together?

141
08:59.660 --> 09:02.910
Uhh...

142
09:03.000 --> 09:04.200
Uh...

143
09:04.290 --> 09:07.540
I guess I forgot to tell you.

144
09:08.200 --> 09:13.080
I wanna ask you to let me go,
but I know I deserve this, so...

145
09:18.160 --> 09:19.910
"English Translation."

146
09:20.000 --> 09:21.410
Junko says,

147
09:21.500 --> 09:27.120
"That's right. Walk down this street to
the post office and turn left there."

148
09:27.120 --> 09:29.000
You will see the station.

149
09:29.080 --> 09:31.830
It takes five minutes from here.

150
09:32.250 --> 09:36.580
Somehow I have to get back at Takagi today.

151
09:36.660 --> 09:39.790
But the ever-present question is: How?

152
09:42.080 --> 09:44.950
I haven't made a jack-in-the-box in a while.

153
09:45.040 --> 09:47.290
No, I don't have enough materials.

154
09:47.370 --> 09:50.160
At this point, I wouldn't finish in time, anyway.

155
09:50.250 --> 09:51.330
Uhh.

156
09:51.410 --> 09:53.660
Let's see, who should I put on the spot?

157
09:53.750 --> 09:54.870
Nishikata.

158
09:54.950 --> 09:55.790
Huh?

159
09:55.870 --> 09:56.540
Uhh.

160
09:56.620 --> 09:58.500
Yes, sir!

161
09:58.580 --> 10:00.290
Don't "Huh? Yes, sir!" me.

162
10:00.370 --> 10:01.910
Hurry up.

163
10:05.080 --> 10:06.750
Don't worry, it's 16.

164
10:06.830 --> 10:08.500
Huh?

165
10:08.580 --> 10:10.700
Sixteen!

166
10:13.080 --> 10:15.410
You don't even know what class you're in, kid?

167
10:15.500 --> 10:17.040
It's English, not Math!

168
10:17.040 --> 10:18.540
I told you to read aloud!

169
10:18.620 --> 10:20.450
Uh... I'm sorry, sir.

170
10:20.540 --> 10:22.540
Forget it. Sit down.

171
10:24.660 --> 10:26.540
I told you we were on line 16.

172
10:26.620 --> 10:28.450
Way to drop the ball there.

173
10:28.540 --> 10:31.620
Yeah, right, you were intentionally
vague, so I'd mess it up.

174
10:31.620 --> 10:32.750
Really.

175
10:32.830 --> 10:34.540
I didn't think you'd actually mess that up.

176
10:34.620 --> 10:35.580
Called it.

177
10:37.000 --> 10:38.120
What's wrong?

178
10:38.200 --> 10:40.660
Are you preoccupied with something?

179
10:40.750 --> 10:42.700
You could say that.

180
10:42.790 --> 10:44.910
Mind if I ask what it is?

181
10:47.580 --> 10:48.500
Ehh.

182
10:48.580 --> 10:50.500
It's really not worth mentioning.

183
10:50.580 --> 10:52.750
Huuuuh...

184
10:52.830 --> 10:54.120
Then...

185
10:56.830 --> 11:00.160
Were you thinking about something naughty?

186
11:00.250 --> 11:01.200
Wha...?!

187
11:01.290 --> 11:03.080
No way! Of course not!

188
11:03.160 --> 11:03.950
Really?

189
11:04.040 --> 11:04.660
I would never!

190
11:04.750 --> 11:05.870
Not in a million years!

191
11:05.950 --> 11:08.000
What kinda guy do ya' think I am?!

192
11:08.080 --> 11:10.160
I know. I know.

193
11:10.250 --> 11:12.370
You were just trying to think of new way to

194
11:12.380 --> 11:14.670
get back at me for all the teasing I do, right?

195
11:16.200 --> 11:17.040
Nuh-uh.

196
11:17.120 --> 11:18.790
No idea what you mean.

197
11:18.870 --> 11:20.500
I know I'm right.

198
11:20.580 --> 11:22.540
You were looking at me earlier, so...

199
11:22.620 --> 11:24.620
...it wasn't that hard to figure out.

200
11:25.500 --> 11:27.580
If you already knew, then why'd you ask?

201
11:27.660 --> 11:30.710
'Cus it's fun to see how you react when I mess with you.

202
11:31.370 --> 11:32.370
So what?

203
11:32.450 --> 11:34.410
Did you come up with a good idea?

204
11:34.500 --> 11:35.910
Hmph!

205
11:36.000 --> 11:37.250
Yup, sure did.

206
11:37.330 --> 11:39.790
You see, I came up with a perfect plan.

207
11:39.870 --> 11:42.410
Oh and this time it's absolutely foolproof.

208
11:42.500 --> 11:43.700
So...

209
11:43.790 --> 11:45.830
Hmm...

210
11:45.910 --> 11:48.580
I'll believe it when I see it.

211
11:48.660 --> 11:50.160
She's not worried at all.

212
11:50.250 --> 11:53.580
It's like she can read my mind,
so she knows I don't have a plan!

213
11:53.580 --> 11:54.540
Spill it.

214
11:54.620 --> 11:56.160
What's this plan of yours?

215
11:56.250 --> 11:58.410
What idiot would tell you that?

216
11:58.500 --> 12:00.000
Oh fine, how about just a hint?

217
12:00.080 --> 12:01.250
I'm not telling you!

218
12:01.330 --> 12:03.000
Just pay attention.

219
12:04.120 --> 12:06.160
Wait, today's the eighteenth.

220
12:06.250 --> 12:10.290
The teachers always call on the kid
whose student number matches the date.

221
12:10.290 --> 12:12.040
And today that's Takagi!

222
12:12.120 --> 12:14.560
If I can get her attention away from
class, she might get

223
12:14.570 --> 12:16.950
in trouble for not knowing where we are in the textbook!</c>

224
12:16.950 --> 12:18.550
Hey, Takagi?

225
12:19.330 --> 12:20.700
D'you eat breakfast today?

226
12:20.790 --> 12:22.160
Whadja have?

227
12:22.250 --> 12:24.330
Yeah, mountain yam over rice.

228
12:24.410 --> 12:25.700
Why ask?

229
12:25.790 --> 12:26.870
Ehh.

230
12:26.950 --> 12:28.580
Just curious.

231
12:31.160 --> 12:33.330
So you like mountain yams?

232
12:33.410 --> 12:34.910
Yeah, I like 'em.

233
12:35.000 --> 12:38.040
I usually have energy all day
when I eat them in the morning.

234
12:38.120 --> 12:38.830
Huh.

235
12:38.910 --> 12:40.950
Yeah, I kinda getcha.

236
12:41.040 --> 12:42.250
What'd you eat?

237
12:42.330 --> 12:43.250
Me?

238
12:43.330 --> 12:45.580
Uh, I had...

239
12:45.660 --> 12:46.910
Bet you can't guess.

240
12:47.000 --> 12:49.620
Hmm, I wonder.

241
12:49.700 --> 12:51.120
Rice?

242
12:51.200 --> 12:53.040
Rice? Why's that?

243
12:53.120 --> 12:56.200
Well, I didn't peg you as a toast kinda guy.

244
12:56.290 --> 12:57.160
Am I wrong?

245
12:57.250 --> 12:59.330
No. You're right, I had rice.

246
12:59.410 --> 13:00.500
It's working!

247
13:00.580 --> 13:02.830
Just keep her attention off of the lesson!

248
13:02.910 --> 13:05.410
So uhh... you on team rice?

249
13:05.500 --> 13:08.910
I want someone to read the next page aloud.

250
13:09.000 --> 13:12.830
Today's the eighteenth, so how about Takagi.

251
13:12.910 --> 13:16.080
Here we go! Heh heh heh.

252
13:17.450 --> 13:19.200
You don't know where we are, do you?

253
13:19.290 --> 13:21.910
Do you?

254
13:22.000 --> 13:24.450
"I will not do such a thing."

255
13:24.540 --> 13:26.120
Thank you. Very nice.

256
13:26.200 --> 13:28.330
What?

257
13:28.410 --> 13:29.660
Hmph.

258
13:31.830 --> 13:33.080
Nice try.

259
13:33.160 --> 13:35.750
Wh-What are you talking about?

260
13:36.870 --> 13:38.410
Man, she's good!

261
13:38.500 --> 13:40.000
I can never seem to get her!

262
13:40.080 --> 13:41.910
Gotta come up with another plan.

263
13:42.000 --> 13:45.350
Maybe I can take it back to basics and
hit her with the old jack-in-the-box?

264
13:45.910 --> 13:48.540
No, I don't have the materials!

265
13:48.620 --> 13:50.330
Been over this!

266
13:51.410 --> 13:52.330
Okay.

267
13:52.410 --> 13:53.700
What is it this time?

268
13:53.790 --> 13:55.750
Uh? It's, uhh...

269
13:55.830 --> 13:57.910
Nothing, forget it.

270
13:58.000 --> 14:01.410
By any chance, were you thinking about me again?

271
14:03.540 --> 14:04.830
No, not really.

272
14:04.910 --> 14:06.700
Not in so many words.

273
14:06.790 --> 14:08.910
Plus, why would I think about you?

274
14:09.000 --> 14:10.500
That'd be weird, wouldn't it?

275
14:10.580 --> 14:12.700
Oooh, then you were thinking something naughty.

276
14:12.790 --> 14:14.200
No! I swear!

277
14:18.660 --> 14:20.040
I know.

278
14:20.120 --> 14:23.080
I'm always thinking about you, though.

279
14:26.200 --> 14:28.790
Hey, you're blushing!

280
14:28.870 --> 14:30.700
No I'm not.

281
14:30.790 --> 14:32.250
And gimme a break.

282
14:32.370 --> 14:35.830
You're just always thinking about
different ways to tease me, aren't you?

283
14:42.790 --> 14:44.540
Eh...

284
14:48.290 --> 14:51.450
Why did she take so long to answer?

285
14:51.540 --> 14:52.910
Today's June eighteenth.

286
14:53.000 --> 14:55.790
If I add the month and date together, it's 24.

287
14:55.870 --> 14:56.870
Number 24!

288
14:56.950 --> 14:58.660
Nishikata!

289
15:13.160 --> 15:17.140
It's the first day we get to go in the
pool, but all I can do is watch.

290
15:18.370 --> 15:20.370
Why'd I have to hurt my hand?

291
15:24.660 --> 15:26.370
It's just not fair.

292
15:26.450 --> 15:28.500
They're all having fun without me.

293
15:28.580 --> 15:29.950
Right?

294
15:30.660 --> 15:33.550
And of course this happens on the
first day that they let us swim.

295
15:33.550 --> 15:34.500
It sucks!

296
15:34.580 --> 15:36.870
So you're sitting out too, I take it?

297
15:36.950 --> 15:38.750
Mm-hmm.

298
15:38.830 --> 15:41.290
For you it's because of your hand, yeah?

299
15:41.370 --> 15:42.750
How'd you hurt it?

300
15:44.830 --> 15:46.040
Yeah.

301
15:46.120 --> 15:49.700
Well, you know, things happen.

302
15:49.790 --> 15:52.810
I bet you tried to pet a cat, but then it bit you.

303
15:53.000 --> 15:55.120
Huh?! Wait, how did you know that?

304
15:55.200 --> 15:57.160
I made an effort not to tell anyone!

305
15:57.250 --> 15:58.910
I'm actually right?

306
15:59.000 --> 16:01.040
I just took a shot in the dark!

307
16:01.120 --> 16:02.410
You are something else!

308
16:07.910 --> 16:09.540
So what's your excuse?

309
16:09.620 --> 16:13.950
Why are you just watching everyone swim... today?

310
16:16.700 --> 16:18.620
That reminds me.

311
16:18.700 --> 16:22.580
Any girl who sits out during
swimming is usually on her period.

312
16:22.580 --> 16:26.540
According to the textbook,
it causes abdominal pain and discomfort.

313
16:26.540 --> 16:30.450
So says Takao, the King of Health Class.

314
16:30.540 --> 16:33.620
Oh, uh, it's nothing, forget it.

315
16:33.700 --> 16:34.830
I shouldn't ask.

316
16:34.910 --> 16:38.450
It's not really any of my business anyway.

317
16:38.540 --> 16:41.410
You wanted to ask why I'm not
swimming today, didn't you?

318
16:41.410 --> 16:43.870
Of course she heard me.

319
16:43.950 --> 16:46.920
Oh. Hey. How about because I figured out your reason

320
16:46.930 --> 16:49.870
is your hand, you take a shot at guessing my reason?

321
16:53.120 --> 16:55.410
You're not feeling good?

322
16:55.500 --> 16:58.000
You have to be more specific than that.

323
16:59.290 --> 17:00.450
No. Forget it.

324
17:00.540 --> 17:02.700
I wasn't actually gonna ask you.

325
17:02.790 --> 17:03.580
Oh?

326
17:03.660 --> 17:05.580
Then are you admitting defeat?

327
17:08.370 --> 17:09.450
All right, fine.

328
17:09.540 --> 17:11.120
I might as well take a guess.

329
17:11.200 --> 17:12.580
Only one, though.

330
17:12.660 --> 17:15.410
Well, not that you'd get it with more tries.

331
17:15.500 --> 17:17.250
She's got me cornered now.

332
17:17.330 --> 17:20.370
Is she this confident because
she thinks I can't say "period"?

333
17:20.450 --> 17:21.830
Because if that's it, I'll show her!

334
17:21.910 --> 17:24.080
I'll say it ten times! 

335
17:24.160 --> 17:26.830
But wait, this is Takagi we're talking about.

336
17:26.910 --> 17:29.330
It could be a trap!

337
17:29.410 --> 17:32.660
Even if I gathered my courage and answered, "Period"!

338
17:32.750 --> 17:34.540
I know what'll happen!

339
17:34.620 --> 17:36.790
No, and that's very rude of you!

340
17:38.950 --> 17:41.120
So that's out of the question.

341
17:41.200 --> 17:44.950
But knowing her, she probably already has
an idea of what's going through my head.

342
17:44.950 --> 17:47.580
I'm hesitating, that's enough for her to figure it out.

343
17:47.660 --> 17:49.750
But if I don't answer at all,

344
17:49.830 --> 17:52.450
well, I think I know how that'll go, too.

345
17:54.910 --> 17:58.400
You don't even know the reason why a girl
is sitting out when she could be swimming?

346
17:58.750 --> 18:01.080
Ha! That means I win, then.

347
18:01.870 --> 18:03.620
Is this a trap or not?

348
18:03.700 --> 18:06.000
Is she making it seem genuine so I'll fall into a trap?

349
18:06.080 --> 18:08.580
Or is she making it seem like a
trap, so I'll worry and mess up?

350
18:08.660 --> 18:11.240
Agh. (I'm) just going in circles here!

351
18:12.080 --> 18:13.120
This sucks.

352
18:13.200 --> 18:14.580
What was with that face before?

353
18:14.660 --> 18:17.080
And was she gripping her stomach or what?

354
18:17.160 --> 18:19.500
Okay, what else could it be?

355
18:19.580 --> 18:21.540
Maybe an injury?

356
18:24.000 --> 18:26.500
I don't know; it doesn't seem like it.

357
18:26.580 --> 18:29.990
It doesn't really look like she's
feeling too sick to be exercising either.

358
18:31.700 --> 18:33.410
Then that leaves.

359
18:33.500 --> 18:34.790
What's left?

360
18:34.870 --> 18:36.790
No.

361
18:41.330 --> 18:43.910
They don't know how good they have it.

362
18:44.000 --> 18:46.580
They get to goof around and cool off in the pool.

363
18:46.660 --> 18:51.370
Meanwhile I'm here in the heat using
all my brain power to battle Takagi.

364
18:51.370 --> 18:53.950
Come on, Nishikata, we don't have all day.

365
18:54.040 --> 18:57.500
You're not just checking out all the
girls in their swimsuits, are you?

366
18:57.500 --> 18:59.120
What? Of course I'm not!

367
18:59.200 --> 19:01.370
Are you sure about that?

368
19:01.450 --> 19:02.750
Because you know what I heard?

369
19:02.830 --> 19:05.250
Boys are usually looking at girls' chests.

370
19:05.330 --> 19:08.330
Whatever, then I'm the exception!

371
19:10.500 --> 19:12.330
I could never say this out loud.

372
19:12.410 --> 19:16.200
But Takagi doesn't have a very big chest.

373
19:16.290 --> 19:19.120
I heard that small-chested girls are...

374
19:19.200 --> 19:20.370
...sensitive about it.

375
19:20.450 --> 19:22.500
So you probs shouldn't bring it up.

376
19:22.580 --> 19:25.660
So says Kimura, the King of Early Lunch.

377
19:25.750 --> 19:29.830
Could it be that she's not swimming because
she has some sort of complex about her body?

378
19:29.830 --> 19:31.910
Like, she's self-conscious?

379
19:32.000 --> 19:34.200
I had a feeling you wouldn't figure it out.

380
19:34.290 --> 19:36.540
That means I win today, too.

381
19:36.620 --> 19:38.040
Oh, Takagi.

382
19:38.120 --> 19:40.250
I do know why.

383
19:40.330 --> 19:44.040
It's obvious that you're just
self-conscious about your chest!

384
19:45.330 --> 19:46.830
Ugh! Yeah, right!

385
19:46.910 --> 19:48.340
Like I could ever say that!

386
19:48.340 --> 19:51.120
It's beyond rude! It's super rude!

387
19:51.200 --> 19:53.540
The only answer I have left is that she's on her period!

388
19:53.620 --> 19:54.950
But that's plenty rude, too.

389
19:55.040 --> 19:57.500
What do I do?

390
19:57.580 --> 19:59.290
You're still thinking it over?

391
19:59.370 --> 20:01.040
We have to go back inside soon.

392
20:01.120 --> 20:01.650
No!

393
20:01.650 --> 20:05.190
They even say in the textbook that it's
nothing to be embarrassed about! It'll be fine!

394
20:05.370 --> 20:06.330
You got this.

395
20:06.410 --> 20:07.870
Just say it with your head held high!

396
20:07.950 --> 20:09.660
It's now or never!

397
20:10.200 --> 20:13.780
The reason you're sitting out in swim class is...

398
20:16.120 --> 20:17.380
...you're on your period.

399
20:21.160 --> 20:22.620
Incorrect.

400
20:23.660 --> 20:26.250
And that's pretty rude to say to a girl.

401
20:26.330 --> 20:31.370
Uh! I just thought that since it was
mentioned in our health textbook, it might--

402
20:32.950 --> 20:35.630
Man Nishikata, your face is bright red!

403
20:38.080 --> 20:39.200
Then is it actually

404
20:39.200 --> 20:41.290
because she's self-conscious about her chest?

405
20:41.370 --> 20:42.540
That's all I got!

406
20:42.620 --> 20:45.870
Ahhh... Too funny.

407
20:49.160 --> 20:51.040
Upsy-daisy.

408
20:56.660 --> 20:58.040
And for the record.

409
20:58.120 --> 21:01.290
Being too self-conscious about my chest...

410
21:03.160 --> 21:04.700
...is also incorrect.

411
21:04.790 --> 21:06.500
Wha...?!

412
21:06.580 --> 21:08.250
Excuse me!

413
21:08.330 --> 21:10.910
I changed my mind, is it okay if I swim?

414
21:11.000 --> 21:12.540
That's fine!

415
21:13.000 --> 21:15.080
Uh... I don't get it.

416
21:15.160 --> 21:17.330
Then why was she sitting out?

417
21:17.410 --> 21:18.540
Okay.

418
21:18.620 --> 21:20.200
Now that I've gotten my fill of funny faces.

419
21:20.290 --> 21:22.250
It's time for a quick swim.

420
21:22.300 --> 21:26.190
Oh, don't tell me you were sitting out that
whole time just so you could tease me more!

Hey. When your hand heals...

422
21:38.200 --> 21:39.850
...then we can swim together.

423
21:50.200 --> 21:51.620
It's cold!

424
21:55.000 --> 21:56.290
I won't fall for it.

425
21:56.370 --> 21:57.750
When we do swim together,

426
21:57.750 --> 22:00.000
I'd bet anything she's gonna mess with me again.

427
22:00.000 --> 22:03.830
After all, that's the kind of person she is.
