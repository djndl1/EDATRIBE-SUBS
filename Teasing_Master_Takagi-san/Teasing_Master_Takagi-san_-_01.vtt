00:04.220 --> 00:05.370
So here, we say,

2
00:05.890 --> 00:07.900
"I am Hanako."

3
00:07.980 --> 00:12.350
As opposed to here, where we say, "He is a teacher."

4
00:16.850 --> 00:18.100
Hey, Nishikata.

5
00:18.160 --> 00:18.780
Huh?

6
00:25.230 --> 00:26.690
What are you doing?

7
00:27.080 --> 00:29.010
Stop accusing me, Takagi.

8
00:29.040 --> 00:30.650
I'm learning.

9
00:32.700 --> 00:34.060
I swear.

10
00:34.390 --> 00:35.800
Right.

11
02:16.550 --> 02:18.770
This'll work well as a spring.

12
02:21.920 --> 02:26.050
Now I have all the pieces I need
to make my desktop jack-in-the-box!

13
02:27.400 --> 02:29.750
Just you wait, Takagi.

14
02:34.810 --> 02:35.980
Huh?

15
02:36.060 --> 02:38.100
Hey. What's going' on?

16
02:38.540 --> 02:39.410
I'm not sure.

17
02:39.410 --> 02:41.770
My pencil case just won't open.

18
02:41.850 --> 02:44.240
Maybe it got dented when I dropped it earlier.

19
02:45.190 --> 02:48.400
Do you think you could try opening it, Nishikata?

20
02:48.480 --> 02:49.230
Uh.

21
02:49.310 --> 02:50.980
Yeah, sure.

22
02:57.520 --> 02:59.440
You must have loosened it or something--

23
03:05.850 --> 03:08.560
What is it, Nishikata?

24
03:08.650 --> 03:10.770
Huh? Oh, it was nothing.

25
03:10.850 --> 03:12.980
I'm sorry for shouting.

26
03:23.810 --> 03:30.060
Seriously, Nishikata, you should see your face.

27
03:30.060 --> 03:30.850
Ugh.

28
03:30.940 --> 03:33.400
Just shut up.

29
03:36.980 --> 03:39.060
You suck.

30
03:39.150 --> 03:41.100
She totally got me.

31
03:41.190 --> 03:45.100
And worse, she got me with what
I was about to get her with!

32
03:46.730 --> 03:48.020
Now that I think about it,

33
03:48.100 --> 03:51.270
it's unusual for Takagi to ask me for help.

34
03:51.350 --> 03:54.100
Why didn't that raise any red flags in my mind?

35
03:54.190 --> 03:57.020
I have to plan my next move.

36
03:57.100 --> 04:00.480
But how am I supposed to embarrass her of all people?

37
04:09.900 --> 04:11.350
Hey.

38
04:12.730 --> 04:14.900
Uh.

39
04:14.980 --> 04:16.440
What's up?

40
04:16.520 --> 04:18.400
Can I borrow your eraser?

41
04:18.480 --> 04:20.310
I forgot mine.

42
04:31.400 --> 04:33.100
How did you forget your eraser?

43
04:33.190 --> 04:36.270
Takagi, you're such an airhead sometimes

44
04:36.350 --> 04:37.230
Guess so.

45
04:37.310 --> 04:39.060
Thank you very much.

46
04:52.560 --> 04:53.870
That reminds me.

47
04:54.650 --> 04:55.310
Hmm?

48
04:55.400 --> 04:56.480
Know what I heard?

49
04:56.560 --> 04:58.270
If you take your eraser,

50
04:58.350 --> 05:01.140
write the name of your crush on it, and use it all up,

51
05:01.170 --> 05:03.150
they'll like you back.

52
05:03.230 --> 05:05.850
Yeah, I've heard that before too.

53
05:05.890 --> 05:08.560
Only a little kid would actually believe it, though.

54
05:10.730 --> 05:12.050
Hmm?

55
05:12.940 --> 05:15.480
A kid, huh?

56
05:16.480 --> 05:18.190
Huuh...?

57
05:25.350 --> 05:27.100
Hmm?

58
05:27.190 --> 05:28.520
Ahh.

59
05:28.600 --> 05:29.690
Huh?!

60
05:29.770 --> 05:31.190
What do you see?

61
05:33.810 --> 05:35.060
Huuuh?

62
05:39.690 --> 05:42.400
Huh? Ohh...

63
05:45.600 --> 05:46.440
Wha...

64
05:46.520 --> 05:47.930
What are you doing?

65
05:54.100 --> 05:56.560
Nothing's written on there, right?

66
05:57.230 --> 05:58.370
C'mon.

67
05:58.430 --> 06:01.600
I'm not some dumb little kid who'd believe that works.

68
06:01.690 --> 06:05.980
Oho? You sure about that?

69
06:06.060 --> 06:07.270
There's no way.

70
06:07.350 --> 06:09.900
You're just making fun of me again, aren't you?

71
06:10.810 --> 06:12.150
Yeah?

72
06:12.230 --> 06:13.510
You think so?

73
06:13.900 --> 06:15.440
Did I actually?

74
06:15.520 --> 06:17.900
Did I actually write something on there?

75
06:17.980 --> 06:20.730
And then just forget that I did?

76
06:26.810 --> 06:30.230
You're done with it, so can you give it back now?

77
06:31.980 --> 06:33.560
Sure.

78
06:33.650 --> 06:35.150
It wasn't me, I swear!

79
06:35.230 --> 06:37.980
Someone else must have gotten a hold of it and then...

80
06:42.400 --> 06:45.770
I knew there was nothing written on that thing!

81
06:45.810 --> 06:46.260
Hey!

82
06:46.370 --> 06:49.520
You didn't forget your eraser, it's right there!

83
06:51.560 --> 06:54.020
No yelling in class.

84
06:54.100 --> 06:55.370
I'm sorry, sir.

85
06:57.850 --> 07:00.600
Not only did you freak out, but you got in trouble!

86
07:03.770 --> 07:06.630
I think that's enough messing around for one class.

87
07:07.060 --> 07:09.350
I should be the one saying that!

88
07:09.440 --> 07:10.850
Mr. Tanabe?

89
07:10.940 --> 07:12.770
May I go to the bathroom?

90
07:12.850 --> 07:13.930
Fine.

91
07:19.230 --> 07:20.810
There's gotta be something.

92
07:20.900 --> 07:23.190
Something I can do to embarrass her.

93
07:23.270 --> 07:24.650
Anything!

94
07:24.730 --> 07:25.940
Huh?

95
07:28.420 --> 07:29.810
That's it!

96
07:30.270 --> 07:35.020
I'll write someone's name on Takagi's eraser and make
fun of her for it when she comes back from the bathroom!

97
07:35.020 --> 07:36.810
Genius!

98
07:36.900 --> 07:38.270
Just one question:

99
07:38.350 --> 07:40.020
Whose name should I write?

100
07:40.100 --> 07:41.190
Huh?

101
07:43.850 --> 07:45.350
There's a name on it already?

102
07:50.440 --> 07:52.270
Should I not look, then?

103
07:52.350 --> 07:54.490
Maybe just a tiny peek.

104
07:58.360 --> 08:01.190
"Lo"? "Lo"?

105
08:01.270 --> 08:03.230
Then that means...

106
08:07.850 --> 08:10.600
...it's not my name.

107
08:13.350 --> 08:17.350
Not that I'm, like, upset or anything.

108
08:33.050 --> 08:34.560
Come on!

109
08:37.600 --> 08:39.400
I'm gonna look at it!

110
08:39.480 --> 08:41.730
I have to know!

111
08:58.110 --> 08:59.440
I can't believe it!

112
08:59.520 --> 09:01.690
She got me again!

113
09:07.190 --> 09:10.850
Nishikata, that face was priceless.

114
09:11.520 --> 09:15.770
And man, you acted exactly how I thought.

115
09:17.520 --> 09:19.540
I just have to tease you.

116
09:19.940 --> 09:21.650
I can't help it.

117
09:23.150 --> 09:23.940
Oh yeah?

118
09:24.020 --> 09:25.480
Well just you wait, Takagi!

119
09:25.560 --> 09:30.060
Mark my words, one of these days I'm gonna
get back at you and embarrass you so bad!

120
09:30.060 --> 09:31.920
Like that'll ever happen.

121
09:33.060 --> 09:35.020
Damn... You don't think I can do it, huh?

122
09:35.100 --> 09:36.010
Well, yeah.

123
09:36.270 --> 09:37.560
I'm serious!

124
09:37.650 --> 09:39.560
You better be on your guard.

125
09:39.650 --> 09:41.600
I think it's impossible.

126
09:41.690 --> 09:43.020
But keep dreaming.

127
09:43.100 --> 09:45.770
You can't even win fifty-percent odds.

128
09:46.690 --> 09:48.350
"Fifty-percent odds"?

129
09:48.440 --> 09:49.270
Whaddya mean?

130
09:49.350 --> 09:51.190
Not telling.

131
09:52.850 --> 09:56.020
Man, day duty is such a pain in the butt.

132
09:59.310 --> 10:03.910
Why do I have to go to school early to
clean the blackboard and write a lesson log?

133
10:05.770 --> 10:07.900
I take it back, day duty's awesome!

134
10:07.980 --> 10:09.290
I guess what they say is true.

135
10:09.290 --> 10:11.230
The early bird gets the worm!

136
10:12.270 --> 10:16.480
I thought this was money, not some stupid arcade token.

137
10:25.810 --> 10:27.730
I just got a great idea!

138
10:27.810 --> 10:32.210
I should use this opportunity to rig
Takagi's desk with some kinda prank.

139
10:33.940 --> 10:36.850
Just thinking about it woke me up a little.

140
10:41.940 --> 10:43.190
Ta...

141
10:48.850 --> 10:50.960
My plan is ruined, she's already here.

142
10:51.810 --> 10:52.750
Wait, why?

143
10:58.190 --> 10:59.670
I don't see anyone here.

144
11:00.260 --> 11:01.490
That's weird.

145
11:01.770 --> 11:04.230
Did I just imagine it or something?

146
11:07.060 --> 11:08.980
No, she's definitely here!

147
11:09.060 --> 11:11.060
My Takagi-sense is tingling!

148
11:11.150 --> 11:13.480
But where is she hiding?

149
11:14.560 --> 11:15.850
And that was a close one.

150
11:15.940 --> 11:17.920
I was about to let my guard down and start humming.

151
11:17.920 --> 11:20.060
But not today!

152
11:20.150 --> 11:22.230
Where are you?

153
11:22.310 --> 11:23.850
Show yourself.

154
11:29.730 --> 11:32.100
You're making this too easy, Takagi.

155
11:32.190 --> 11:34.760
I can see the name on your shoes under the desk.

156
11:35.850 --> 11:39.150
You're probably planning to surprise me
when I go up to clean the blackboard.

157
11:39.560 --> 11:41.330
But I won't give you the chance.

158
11:42.560 --> 11:43.980
Ahh...

159
11:44.060 --> 11:47.810
Day duty is such a pain,
I don't feel like doing anything!

160
11:47.900 --> 11:51.010
Not like anyone will notice if
I don't clean the board anyway.

161
11:52.020 --> 11:53.560
Ooo, stings, doesn't it?

162
11:53.650 --> 11:57.410
You must be mortified that this
silly plan of yours didn't work.

163
11:59.310 --> 12:01.150
I can hardly contain myself!

164
12:01.230 --> 12:03.730
I wanna see the look on her face so bad.

165
12:04.100 --> 12:05.310
But wait...

166
12:05.400 --> 12:07.980
Would Takagi really make such an amateur mistake?

167
12:08.060 --> 12:10.250
This is hide-and-seek 101!

168
12:11.310 --> 12:12.100
No!

169
12:12.190 --> 12:13.270
She wouldn't!

170
12:13.480 --> 12:15.940
Which means that's a trap!

171
12:16.020 --> 12:17.100
That was close.

172
12:17.190 --> 12:18.850
She's devilish, that one.

173
12:18.940 --> 12:20.900
Gotta stay on my toes.

174
12:20.980 --> 12:22.690
So if she's not there,

175
12:22.770 --> 12:24.400
where is she?

176
12:24.480 --> 12:25.940
She's gotta be nearby.

177
12:26.020 --> 12:28.900
She wouldn't miss the opportunity.

178
12:33.400 --> 12:35.400
I don't see her in the hallway,

179
12:35.480 --> 12:38.480
so there's only one place left.

180
12:42.730 --> 12:43.520
Welp!

181
12:43.600 --> 12:45.700
I guess I'll go to the bathroom!

182
12:47.400 --> 12:49.730
Now pretend I'm not here.

183
12:51.940 --> 12:53.610
I got you!

184
12:57.400 --> 12:58.190
What?

185
12:58.270 --> 13:00.270
She's not there!

186
13:01.060 --> 13:02.400
Huh?

187
13:15.310 --> 13:17.690
Well that was a waste of time.

188
13:17.770 --> 13:20.230
What the heck was I doing?

189
13:24.940 --> 13:25.810
Hey!

190
13:31.980 --> 13:33.020
Are you okay?

191
13:33.100 --> 13:34.100
Come on!

192
13:34.190 --> 13:36.020
I didn't look behind the curtain?

193
13:36.100 --> 13:38.900
Totally fooled you, didn't I?

194
13:41.730 --> 13:42.810
If you're up real close,

195
13:42.900 --> 13:44.190
you can see through the curtain,

196
13:44.270 --> 13:46.230
so I saw you the whole time.

197
13:46.310 --> 13:47.100
Not fair!

198
13:47.190 --> 13:48.640
She looks so happy!

199
13:48.640 --> 13:49.940
This sucks!

200
13:50.020 --> 13:51.480
Ahh, that was fun.

201
13:51.560 --> 13:55.690
Just thinking about the look
on your face makes me wanna...

202
13:57.980 --> 14:00.400
This was worth waking up early for.

203
14:00.480 --> 14:02.810
Just to mess with me?

204
14:02.900 --> 14:04.310
Yup!

205
14:09.310 --> 14:11.900
I can't believe she got me again.

206
14:11.980 --> 14:13.230
Hey, Nishikata.

207
14:13.310 --> 14:14.650
Huh?

208
14:20.190 --> 14:21.350
Know what?

209
14:21.440 --> 14:24.100
It's just the two of us in this quiet classroom.

210
14:24.190 --> 14:27.350
Doesn't it feel like we're the only ones in the world?

211
14:29.600 --> 14:33.480
I think it does, and I hope it stays this way.

212
14:36.770 --> 14:39.600
Then, uhh, Takagi?

213
14:39.690 --> 14:46.270
Does that mean that you, maybe, like, like...

214
14:47.560 --> 14:50.560
Good morning everyone!

215
14:50.650 --> 14:52.480
How about this weather am I right?

216
14:52.560 --> 14:53.810
Jeez.

217
14:53.810 --> 14:57.270
I'll never understand how you feel
so energetic in the morning, Mina.

218
14:57.270 --> 15:00.770
Huh? And how else am I supposed to feel, smarty-pants?

219
15:00.850 --> 15:02.310
Tired?

220
15:02.400 --> 15:03.770
You too, Sanae?

221
15:03.850 --> 15:06.600
Saying you're tired makes your happiness go away!

222
15:06.690 --> 15:08.230
I saw it on TV!

223
15:08.310 --> 15:10.440
Not everything on TV is true.

224
15:10.520 --> 15:12.150
You can't actually believe that.

225
15:12.230 --> 15:13.650
Well, I do!

226
15:13.730 --> 15:15.440
It's better to be cheerful anywa--

227
15:15.520 --> 15:16.730
Stop it.

228
15:16.810 --> 15:17.600
Ow, ow, ow.

229
15:17.690 --> 15:19.270
That hurts, can you like, not?

230
15:19.350 --> 15:21.190
Just leave her alone.

231
15:21.270 --> 15:22.940
You two would feel better if you smiled!

232
15:23.020 --> 15:23.810
See?

233
15:23.900 --> 15:25.310
Ignore them. You were saying?

234
15:25.400 --> 15:26.770
Huh?

235
15:26.850 --> 15:27.810
It was nothing.

236
15:27.900 --> 15:29.350
Forget it.

237
15:29.440 --> 15:30.770
Huuuuh?

238
15:32.350 --> 15:33.940
Speaking of forgetting things.

239
15:34.020 --> 15:35.600
Did you clean the board?

240
15:35.690 --> 15:38.190
Ahh! I forgot!

241
15:51.770 --> 15:54.520
How am I gonna pull one over on Takagi?

242
15:54.600 --> 15:56.270
What am I gonna do?

243
15:56.350 --> 15:58.020
Think!

244
15:58.100 --> 15:59.230
Hey, Nishikata.

245
15:59.310 --> 16:01.730
What are you staring at the mirror for?

246
16:01.810 --> 16:03.900
Oh, hey, Nakai.

247
16:03.980 --> 16:06.440
You practicin' putting on a cool face or somethin'?

248
16:06.520 --> 16:08.350
No, that's lame.

249
16:10.190 --> 16:11.810
A funny face, then?

250
16:13.310 --> 16:15.150
Of course. That's it!

251
16:15.230 --> 16:17.770
So like this?

252
16:17.850 --> 16:20.150
By the way, I've been meaning to ask you something.

253
16:20.230 --> 16:22.400
You're pretty close with Takagi, aren't you?

254
16:23.060 --> 16:26.020
So I was wondering', like, you into her?

255
16:28.020 --> 16:31.440
Well, he's clearly ignoring me,
which means I must be on the right track.

256
16:31.440 --> 16:32.350
Yo, dude.

257
16:32.440 --> 16:34.730
You totally like Takagi, don't you?

258
16:36.650 --> 16:39.150
That face was so weird, man!

259
16:40.150 --> 16:44.350
I had no idea I had such talent lying dormant within me.

260
16:44.350 --> 16:47.350
Okay, everyone settle down, let's get to work.

261
16:47.440 --> 16:49.480
Open your books to page 36.

262
16:49.560 --> 16:50.770
This is perfect!

263
16:50.850 --> 16:53.000
We just so happen to have the scariest teacher,

264
16:53.030 --> 16:54.520
Mr. Tanabe, right now!

265
16:54.600 --> 16:59.650
I'll use my funny face to make you laugh so
hard, you'll get in deep trouble, Takagi!

266
17:07.270 --> 17:09.980
Oh man, I wanna make Takagi laugh now.

267
17:10.060 --> 17:12.270
No. I have to be patient.

268
17:12.350 --> 17:16.390
I have to wait until she starts a
conversation to mess with me, like I planned.

269
17:17.270 --> 17:19.230
The best moment to mess with someone is when

270
17:19.240 --> 17:21.310
they're about to mess with someone themselves. 

271
17:21.310 --> 17:23.350
They'll never expect it then!

272
17:23.440 --> 17:25.400
And that's when I strike!

273
17:25.480 --> 17:27.600
All right, girl, come at me.

274
17:27.690 --> 17:30.440
I'm wide open!

275
17:30.520 --> 17:32.100
Hey, uhh, Nishikata?

276
17:32.190 --> 17:34.100
Yes!

277
17:34.190 --> 17:36.400
Whatever do you need, Takagi?

278
17:36.480 --> 17:38.480
Take this!

279
17:38.560 --> 17:39.730
Huh?

280
17:43.400 --> 17:45.270
Hmmm...

281
17:45.350 --> 17:47.650
Huh?

282
17:51.980 --> 17:53.060
Hey.

283
17:54.480 --> 17:56.900
How many times do I have to tell you to be quiet?

284
17:56.980 --> 17:58.980
I'm sorry! I won't do it again!

285
17:59.060 --> 17:59.980
He's so scary.

286
18:04.100 --> 18:05.900
This sucks!

287
18:05.980 --> 18:09.230
I wasn't sure what you were trying
to do at first, but now, I get it.

288
18:09.230 --> 18:11.190
You're not very creative.

289
18:11.270 --> 18:12.060
Wha?

290
18:12.150 --> 18:13.730
If you really wanna be funny.

291
18:13.810 - -> 18:16.190
You should push your eyebrows up like this.

292
18:16.270 --> 18:19.290
Oh, and do this with your cheeks, too.

293
18:21.190 --> 18:22.350
So like this?

294
18:22.440 --> 18:23.600
Yeah, yeah.

295
18:23.690 --> 18:25.350
Okay, you're getting there.

296
18:25.440 --> 18:28.690
Honestly, it's looking better than before already.

297
18:28.770 --> 18:30.100
What is happening?

298
18:30.190 --> 18:32.230
Now stick your lips out like a duck bill.

299
18:32.310 --> 18:33.770
That'll be super funny.

300
18:33.850 --> 18:36.270
I wanted to make a silly face to make her laugh.

301
18:36.350 --> 18:39.810
And now I'm getting pointers
on how to do it from my target.

302
18:39.900 --> 18:43.190
It's kind of humiliating.

303
18:43.270 --> 18:44.560
Whatever!

304
18:44.650 --> 18:46.600
All I want is for Takagi to laugh and get in trouble!

305
18:46.690 --> 18:49.400
I couldn't care less who helps me make that happen!

306
18:49.480 --> 18:50.850
Like this?

307
18:50.940 --> 18:52.850
Yeah, that's perfect!

308
18:52.940 --> 18:54.940
It looks way better now!

309
18:55.020 --> 18:55.940
Okay.

310
18:56.020 --> 18:57.900
Then why aren't you laughing yet?

311
18:57.980 --> 19:01.230
I'll laugh really hard if you
turn to your left right now.

312
19:01.230 --> 19:02.020
All right.

313
19:02.100 --> 19:03.060
This is the moment.

314
19:03.150 --> 19:05.480
Here we go!

315
19:17.730 --> 19:20.600
What are you doing, Nishikata?

316
19:20.690 --> 19:21.310
Sorry!

317
19:21.400 --> 19:22.810
I'm really sorry, sir!

318
19:24.230 --> 19:26.230
Always with the antics.

319
19:26.310 --> 19:28.400
Take my class seriously, will you?

320
19:28.480 --> 19:29.480
I will.

321
19:29.560 --> 19:30.810
And sorry again.

322
19:34.690 --> 19:36.310
My stomach hurts from laughing!

323
19:36.400 --> 19:39.560
I guess I technically got her to laugh, like I wanted.

324
19:39.560 --> 19:42.150
But she won that round.

325
19:43.810 --> 19:46.060
Hey. Hey, Nishikata.

326
19:51.060 --> 19:53.060
Okay, that's enough playing around.

327
19:53.150 --> 19:56.440
If I make Mr. Tanabe angry again, he'll kill me!

328
19:56.520 --> 20:00.460
I gotta make sure I don't get involved
with Takagi for the rest of the class.

329
20:14.480 --> 20:16.630
You finally decided to look at me.

330
20:24.560 --> 20:26.810
We should totally have a staring contest.

331
20:26.900 --> 20:29.760
One. Two. Three.

332
20:34.410 --> 20:36.690
That face is so weird!

333
20:36.770 --> 20:37.730
Nishikata!

334
20:37.810 --> 20:39.690
What did I say?

335
20:39.770 --> 20:45.270
Whenever Takagi gets my heart racing,
things don't play out the way I want them to.

336
22:22.980 --> 22:23.980
Ugh.

337
22:24.060 --> 22:25.900
I'm exhausted, yet again.

338
22:25.980 --> 22:27.150
What did I say?

339
22:27.230 --> 22:29.940
Don't say you're tired, it'll make things worse!

340
22:30.020 --> 22:31.770
It takes your happiness away!

341
22:31.850 --> 22:33.560
Yeah, whatever.

342
22:44.100 --> 22:44.940
What's up?

343
22:45.020 --> 22:46.310
Are you doing okay?

344
22:46.400 --> 22:48.310
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

345
22:48.400 --> 22:49.940
You two go on ahead.

346
22:50.020 --> 22:51.020
Why?

347
22:51.100 --> 22:52.940
I'm just feeling a little tired, (that) is all.

348
22:53.020 --> 22:55.310
By your rules, there goes your happiness.

349
22:55.400 --> 22:56.810
Huh?

350
22:56.900 --> 22:58.900
Yeah, guess you're right.

351
22:58.980 --> 23:00.270
Mina.

352
23:00.350 --> 23:03.270
Care to tell us what you're hiding under your foot?

353
23:03.350 --> 23:04.690
Whatever do you mean?

354
23:04.770 --> 23:07.150
I always stand like this.

355
23:13.980 --> 23:15.560
Wait, no fair!

356
23:15.650 --> 23:17.120
I found that hundred yen!

357
23:17.120 --> 23:19.730
What happened to finders keepers?

358
23:19.810 --> 23:21.980
You are so greedy.

359
23:22.060 --> 23:23.560
Mina.

360
23:23.650 --> 23:24.440
Come on.

361
23:24.520 --> 23:25.810
It's a token.

362
23:27.310 --> 23:29.430
It must'ave turned into that when I said I was tired.

363
23:29.430 --> 23:31.330
I told you it was real.

364
23:31.440 --> 23:34.290
You know that's not how the world works.

02:09.960 --> 02:13.960
